FuckFuckAdblock
===============

A simple userscript that acts like FuckAdBlock.js but always says that no adblock was detected. Just install it and try it out at http://sitexw.fr/fuckadblock/. FuckFuckAdBlock works on the current version of FuckAdBlock(v3.1.0) and any version before that. [It's kinda like a trace buster buster][tracebusterbuster]
